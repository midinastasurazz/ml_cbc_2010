% [cbr] = retain(cbr, solvedcase)
% updates the CBR system by storing the solved case solvedcase.
% (Hint: You may wish to write a function that stores a lot of cases in the CBR
% system in one go. This functionality will enable to use the function during
% initialization as well. Think what will happen if you try to add a case to the
% CBR system that is already known to the system.
